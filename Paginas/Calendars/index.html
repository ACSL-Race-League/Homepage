            <h2>Rookie</h2>
            <p> Season 7 introduces an almost completely refreshed
                calendar built around circuits that are perfectly suited to the Mazda MX‑5 Cup and ideal for rookie
                drivers.
                The selected layouts are short, technical and easy to read, allowing new drivers to develop quickly
                without
                being overwhelmed by complex or extremely fast tracks. At the same time, they remain challenging enough
                to
                guarantee close racing and exciting on‑track battles.
                With a mix of national layouts and lesser‑used variants of well‑known circuits, ACSL presents a fresh
                and
                varied schedule that is almost entirely new to the league. It is the perfect way to keep everyone sharp
                and
                give the championship a dynamic new energy.</p>

            <h2>Pro</h2>
            <p> The ACSL Pro Sprint Series returns in Season 7 with a familiar yet demanding calendar built around
                circuits
                that reward precision and racecraft.
                Many of the selected tracks are returning venues from previous seasons, offering experienced drivers the
                chance to refine their skills on layouts known for their technical complexity and strategic depth.
                From the flowing corners of Misano to the elevation changes at Watkins Glen Boot and the high-speed
                rhythm
                of Suzuka GP, each round challenges drivers to get the most out of the GR86. This Pro calendar favors
                consistency, clean battles, and smart driving. A true test for those aiming to master the Sprint format.

            <h2>Endurance</h2>
            <p> Season 7 introduces the very first ACSL Endurance Series, featuring a selection of circuits that are
                naturally suited for long‑distance racing.
                Each track on the calendar is a trusted venue for multi‑hour events, known for their flowing layouts,
                strategic pacing and the ability to keep drivers focused over extended stints.
                Misano and Road America set the tone with their mix of rhythm and technical sections, while Interlagos
                and
                Portimão add elevation changes and high‑commitment corners that reward smooth, consistent driving. The
                season concludes with Road Atlanta, a classic endurance venue that demands full concentration from start
                to
                finish.
                This inaugural Endurance calendar is built to highlight patience, teamwork and race management, offering
                a
                fresh challenge for ACSL drivers who want to push beyond sprint racing.
